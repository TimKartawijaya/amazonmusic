Last.Fm Music Personalization and Recommmender System

This project aims to create a personalization/recommender system using the Last.fm Music dataset (http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html). First, we will implement neighborhood-based (KNN) and model-based (matrix factorization) collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend items to users, then we will use a more complex methodology (FM, ANN) to perform recommendations.

You can download the full dataset (~1.64 GB) here:
