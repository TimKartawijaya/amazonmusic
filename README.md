Amazon Music Personalization and Recommmender System

This project aims to create a personalization/recommender system using the Amazon Music dataset (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). First, we will implement neighborhood-based and model-based collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend items to users, then we will use a more complex algorithm (MNAR, KKN) to make recommendations.
