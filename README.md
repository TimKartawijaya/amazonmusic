Last.Fm Music Personalization and Recommmender System

This project aims to create a personalization/recommender system using the Last.fm Music dataset (http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~ocelma/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-360K.html). First, we will implement neighborhood-based and model-based collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend items to users, then we will use a more complex methodology (MNAR, KKN) to make recommendations. 

You can download the full dataset (~1.64 GB) here:
